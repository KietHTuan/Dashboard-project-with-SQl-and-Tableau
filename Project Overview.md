# Dashboard-project-with-SQl-and-Tableau
This data analysis project encompassed a complete cycle from gathering requirements to querying data using SQL, analyzing key metrics, and creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau. 

## Problems and Requirements 
The stakeholders at an eCommerce enterprise specializing in technology products require two dashboards to be built for sales performance tracking:
1. Sales Performance Dashboard (Includes Sales, MonthlySalesGrowth, SalesMovingAverage, OrderCount, OverRunningOrderCount, AverageCustomerSales, GlobalSalesValue)
2. General Performance Dashboard (Includes TransportCost, OrderCount, OverRunnningOrderCount, Running SalesValue, WeeklyFreightGrowth, AverageCustomerOrderCount, GlobalFreightCost)

*For both of the dashboards, they must:
1. Have filter options by the year
2. Contain data for the three years 2017, 2018, 2019 only. 

## About the dataset 
This is the dataset about an eCommerce enterprise product sales provided by dropbox, and even though the origin company information has been anonymized, an assessment of data quality (checking for nulls, outliers, inconsistencies) has been done before the analysis.
