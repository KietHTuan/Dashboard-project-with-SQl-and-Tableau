# Dashboard-project-with-SQl-and-Tableau
This data analysis project encompassed a complete cycle from gathering requirements to querying data using SQL, analyzing key metrics, and creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau. 

## Problems and Requirements 
The stakeholders at an eCommerce enterprise specializing in technology products require two dashboards to be built for sales performance tracking:
1. Sales Performance Dashboard (Includes Sales, MonthlySalesGrowth, SalesMovingAverage, OrderCount, OverRunningOrderCount, GlobalSalesValue)
2. General Performance Dashboard (Includes TransportCost, OrderCount, OverRunnningOrderCount, Running SalesValue, WeeklyFreightGrowth, GlobalFreightCost)

*For both of the dashboards, they must:
1. Have filter options by the year
2. Contain data for the three years 2017, 2018, 2019 only.
